ïƒ˜ Exercise 10: Type Conversion and Complex Numbers
Problem Statement: Write a Python program to:
1. Convert a floating-point number to an integer and vice versa.
2. Create a complex number from two user inputs (real and imaginary parts) and display its
real and imaginary components.
3. Calculate the conjugate of the complex number.

a = 3.14
b = 5
c = 3 + 4j

conv_a = int(a)

convert_c = complex(c)

convert_c = real, imag = convert_c.real, convert_c.imag
